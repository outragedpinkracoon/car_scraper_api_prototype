I want to automate the car searches I've been doing on Arnold Clark, for upgrading our car in March. This is an api that will surface the top matching cars, and eventually suggest the best one to buy.

Rails wasn't the best idea (hence the pmaps!), but there was some concepts I wanted to practice. I'll eventually rewrite it in Node or Elixir.

Further work will be to scrape thousands of cars to use in a preductive model in Python that will learn the kinds of cars I'd like to buy. It's nice to dream!
